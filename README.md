# YouTube Vanced - Magisk Repo

This is the official magisk repo version of the Youtube Vanced project, more info and support in the [official thread on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-youtube-vanced-edition-t3758757)
The version in this repo **ONLY supports arm/arm64/x86/x86_64 devices and minAPI21 systems**. There is also a [black themed variant](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/iYTBP-Vanced-black-Magisk-Repo) of this version available.

### NOTE:
**Due to theme modification changes since Youtube Vanced build 01.17.10 (theme is in-app switchable now!) white and dark stock themed variants are combined in one version and are provided in this repo.
White stock theme is used by default if u start the app the first time. If u want to use the dark stock theme u can switch to it via Vanced "Layout Settings". The black mod themed variant of
this module will have the black theme instead the dark stock theme included**

**Detach/Attach app from Playstore:
Due to multiple reported issues for some users (eg. apps auto update broken) and since update from 10.04.18 detaching is by default disabled. If u want to enable it u have to put a file (can be empty) called "enable_detach"
into your /cache directory and reboot the phone. 60 seconds after reboot the app gets detached from playstore. If u want to disable detaching again put a file called "disable_detach" (can be empty) into /cache directory and
reboot the phone like with detaching 60 seconds after reboot it gets attached to playstore again.
WARNING: Due to the hacky nature of this method there might come up unexpected issues with the playstore and it's functions. So be warned and enable it at your own risk!**

**This repo gets always updated `AFTER` the official Apk variants are available/released so expect up-to-date delays**
